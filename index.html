    <h1>2016 Toyota Tacoma Handling and Breaking</h1>
  </header>
  <div class="content">
  	<p>The 2016 Toyota Tacoma comes with standard rear-wheel drive or optional four-wheel drive. Most reviewers find that
  	the Tacoma has good ride comfort, but others agree that, as with most trucks, the ride feels unsettled over imperfect
  	pavement. Test drivers write that the brakes provide ample stopping power and the steering is well-weighted.</p>

  	<ul class="quotes">
		<li>"The ride is good on smooth pavement, acceptable on rough pavement, and downright punishing on
		potholed roads, with little difference noted in 2WD and 4WD models, and Access and Double Cabs." -- <a href="http://www.automobilemag.com/reviews/driven/1508-2016-toyota-tacoma-review/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Automobile Magazine</a></li>
		<li>"Regardless of those drums, the truck's braking power felt acceptable on our drive." -- <a href="http://autoweek.com/article/car-reviews/2016-toyota-tacoma-first-drive" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">AutoWeek</a></li>
		<li>"Body roll is gradual and restrained, and there's an overall coordination that makes the trip to the
		trailhead enjoyable. Best perhaps is the steering, which offers up a steady sense of direction, with effort
		that builds up smoothly and returns the wheel to center accurately as we bend in and out of turns." -- <a href="http://www.edmunds.com/toyota/tacoma/2016/road-test.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Edmunds</a></li>
		<li>"Handling feels better, and the ride is comfortable and compliant. The brakes, still discs in front
		and drums in the rear, use an all-new braking system that has a confident and linear feel." -- <a href="http://www.kbb.com/car-news/all-the-latest/2016-toyota-tacoma-v6-first-review-more-modern-more-efficient-more-capable/2000012350/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kelley Blue Book</a></li>
		<li>"On everyday roads the Tacoma rides like a typical truck. Thanks to its separate frame and solid axle
		rear end, the Tacoma tends to bounce over road surfaces, even ones that appear to be fairly smooth. Your
		average pickup truck buyer probably won't mind the Tacoma's ride, but someone switching from something like
		a car-based crossover might be in for a minor shock." -- <a href="http://www.leftlanenews.com/first-drive-2016-toyota-tacoma-review-89383.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Left Lane News</a></li>
